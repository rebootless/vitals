A terminal resource monitor for Linux built with [notcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses). Displays CPU, memory, network, storage, and thermal data in a responsive multi-panel TUI.

## Panels

| Panel | Data source | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| **CPU**     | `/proc/stat`, cpufreq | Overall % + per-core bars + sparkline history + frequencies |
| **GPU**     | DRM sysfs, hwmon, `nvidia-smi` | Utilization, VRAM (when available), temp/power; AMD, Intel, nouveau, proprietary NVIDIA |
| **Memory**  | `/proc/meminfo` | RAM and swap usage with gradient bars |
| **Network** | `/proc/net/dev` | Per-interface RX/TX throughput with peak tracking |
| **Storage** | `/proc/diskstats`, `statvfs` | Root filesystem bar + per-disk I/O |
| **Thermal** | `/sys/class/thermal`, `/sys/class/hwmon` | Thermal zones + hwmon sensors (coretemp, k10temp) |

GPU is shown only when a supported device is detected; otherwise the CPU panel keeps the full column height.

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `q` | Quit |
| `Esc` | Open settings (theme, background, TTY mode, refresh rate) |
| `Tab` | Next setting (while settings are open) |
| `↑` / `↓` | Change the focused setting |
| `Enter` | Save settings and close |
| `Esc` (in settings) | Cancel and restore previous values |

## Installation

### Quick install

Downloads, builds, and installs the binary to `/usr/local/bin` in one step:

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rebootless/vitals/main/install.sh)
```

The installer handles everything automatically: apt dependencies, cloning notcurses into the repo, building, and placing the binary in PATH. Safe to re-run.

### Manual install

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rebootless/vitals.git
cd vitals
```

**2. Prepare the build environment**

`setup.sh` installs apt dependencies and clones notcurses as a required subdirectory:

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

**3. Build**

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_PANDOC=OFF
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

**4. Install**

```bash
sudo cmake --install build
echo "/usr/local/lib" | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/usr_local_lib.conf
sudo ldconfig
```

`cmake --install` places the `vitals` binary in `/usr/local/bin` and the notcurses shared libraries in `/usr/local/lib`.

### Manual build (run in place, no system install)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rebootless/vitals.git
cd vitals
bash setup.sh
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DUSE_PANDOC=OFF
cmake --build build -j$(nproc)
```

Run directly from the build tree:

```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$(pwd)/build/notcurses" ./build/vitals
```

## Screenshots

## How it builds

notcurses is included as a source subdirectory (`add_subdirectory(notcurses)`) and compiled together with vitals. This means no pre-installed notcurses package is required — `setup.sh` clones the source and cmake takes care of the rest.

## Requirements

- Linux (kernel ≥ 4.x)
- GCC or Clang with C++20 support
- CMake ≥ 3.14
- Internet access (notcurses is cloned from source)
- Debian 12 / 13 or Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04
